/**
 * Webhook signature verification -- the trust boundary every downstream gate depends on.
 *
 * CONST-HMAC-OVER-RAW-BODY: the raw request bytes are verified against `X-Hub-Signature-256`
 * with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` BEFORE any parse. `@octokit/webhooks` owns that comparison
 * internally, so this module delegates to `Webhooks#verify` and never hand-rolls HMAC nor
 * compares signatures with `===`. A signature computed over different bytes than were sent
 * fails verification, and such a request is rejected 401 before a single field is read.
 *
 * node:http, not express: `express.json()` consumes the stream and re-serializes the body, so
 * the bytes handed to an HMAC check are no longer the bytes GitHub signed -- verification then
 * either always fails or gets quietly stripped to make things work. A hand-rolled node:http
 * handler reads the raw stream once and verifies those exact bytes. This also owns its own
 * status codes, which `createNodeMiddleware` cannot: its 400 is hardcoded and its options
 * expose only `{ timeout, path, log }`, so a 400->401 remap is impossible through it.
 *
 * Status map: 405 non-POST · 415 non-JSON content type · 401 missing or invalid signature ·
 * 400 missing GitHub event/delivery headers · 413 body over limit · 500 unexpected throw.
