/**
 * The forge-neutral half of a webhook endpoint: read a bounded raw body, recognise a JSON content type,
 * and write a small JSON response.
 *
 * Extracted from verify.mjs when a second forge arrived (issue #42), and extracted rather than copied for
 * one reason: `readRawBody`'s per-chunk accounting is a memory bound on attacker-controlled input. Two
 * copies of a security limit drift -- one gets the fix, the other keeps the bug -- and the copy that keeps
 * it is the one nobody is looking at. Verification itself is NOT here; each forge's gate owns its own,
 * because that is exactly the part that differs.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a header that identifies a forge, and nothing here decides whether a request is
 * trusted. A caller must still verify before parsing a single field (CONST-HMAC-OVER-RAW-BODY).
