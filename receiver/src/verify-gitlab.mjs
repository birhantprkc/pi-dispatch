/**
 * The GitLab trust boundary (issue #42), the counterpart of verify.mjs. Nothing downstream -- not the
 * access-level gate, not the label predicate, not the enqueue -- means anything unless this ran first and
 * said yes: every one of them reads fields from a body somebody has to have authenticated
 * (CONST-HMAC-OVER-RAW-BODY).
 *
 * GitLab offers TWO mechanisms, and which one a deployment gets depends on its version:
 *
 *   - `signature` -- a real HMAC-SHA256, `webhook-signature: v1,<base64>`, over the Standard Webhooks
 *     message `{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{raw body}`. Available from GitLab 19.0 (GA 19.1).
 *   - `token` -- `X-Gitlab-Token` compared against a shared secret. Available on every version, and
 *     STRICTLY WEAKER: it proves the sender knew a secret, and says nothing about whether the body
 *     arrived as it was sent. It is offered because most self-hosted instances cannot do better yet, not
 *     because it is adequate.
 *
 * The mode is DECLARED in config and verified exactly, never negotiated from what the request happens to
 * carry. That is the whole reason it is a config field: a handler that accepted whichever header showed up
 * would let the sender choose which gate it faced, and an attacker would choose the weaker one every time.
 * A delivery arriving without the declared mode's header is refused, even when the other one is present
 * and correct.
 *
 * Raw-body-then-verify-then-parse holds exactly as in verify.mjs: `readRawBody` returns bytes, the HMAC is
 * computed over those bytes, and `onVerified` gets the string. Nothing calls JSON.parse before the 401.
