/**
 * The Azure DevOps trust boundary.
 *
 * WHAT AZURE CANNOT DO, stated first because everything here follows from it: Service Hooks offer no HMAC.
 * The only authentication a subscription can carry is HTTP Basic credentials or a static custom header. A
 * bare credential proves the sender knew a secret and COVERS NO BYTES -- it says nothing about whether the
 * body arrived as it was sent.
 *
 * So `CONST-HMAC-OVER-RAW-BODY` is satisfied here in one half and not the other, and this is not a new
 * class of exception: it is exactly GitLab's `token` mode, which that entry already admits BY NAME. What
 * does NOT vary, and is preserved exactly, is the ordering the whole downstream depends on -- raw bytes,
 * then verify, then parse -- and the refusal to let the request choose which mechanism it faces.
 *
 * TWO CONSEQUENCES AN OPERATOR HAS TO KNOW ABOUT, both documented rather than papered over:
 *
 *   - The DELIVERY ID IS IN THE BODY. Azure sends no delivery-id header at all, so the dedup key
 *     (`REQ-DEDUP-BY-DELIVERY-GUID`) is read from the verified payload. `verify-gitlab.mjs` explicitly
 *     REFUSES to do this -- it 400s rather than synthesise a key from payload content -- and that refusal
 *     is right for a forge that HAS a header and wrong for one that has none. The distinction is the
 *     difference between an exception and an erosion, so it is written down rather than inferred. Note the
 *     ordering is unaffected: the id is read inside `onVerified`, after the credential check.
 *   - There is NO REPLAY WINDOW. GitLab pairs its dedup with a signed 5-minute timestamp precisely because
 *     dedup is retention-bounded. Azure signs no timestamp and no body, so a captured delivery replays as
 *     new paid work once the job key ages out, and there is no second line of defence. `OQ-015` records it.
 *
 * HTTPS is the operator's obligation and the docs say so: over plain HTTP the credential is on the wire in
 * base64, which is not encryption.
