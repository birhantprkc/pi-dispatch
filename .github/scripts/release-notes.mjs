/**
 * AI-written GitHub Release notes, for whichever artifact is being released.
 *
 * Reads the commit list (COMMITS), the version (VERSION), the subject (PRODUCT, PRODUCT_DESC) and the key
 * (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) from the environment, asks Claude for notes, and prints them to stdout. Exits
 * NON-ZERO on any failure so the release workflow falls back to a plain commit list — a missing key or a
 * flaky API never blocks a release. Model is overridable via RELEASE_MODEL (default: a current Sonnet).
 *
 * PRODUCT is READ rather than hard-coded because two workflows call this script: release.yml ships the
 * admin extension (`admin-v*`) and repo-release.yml ships the whole tool (`v*`). It named the extension
 * unconditionally, so every tool release asked the model to describe the operator extension and then
 * handed it repo-wide commits to describe it with. The name is the caller's fact, not this file's.
 *
 * THE LENGTH CEILING IS IMPOSED HERE, NOT REQUESTED IN THE PROMPT. These notes are read in the few seconds
 * between seeing a tag and deciding whether to upgrade; asking for "terse bullet points" produced 694 words
 * of prose, section headings and a config sample at v0.3.0. So the prompt asks for the shape and `tighten`
 * then enforces it — a prompt that asks for brevity is a request, and a slice is a guarantee. Detail is not
 * lost, it is relocated: the workflow appends a compare link, which is what lets these stay short.
