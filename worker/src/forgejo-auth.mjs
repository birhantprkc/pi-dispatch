/**
 * Forgejo/Gitea authentication for the worker: the counterpart of get-token.mjs and gitlab-auth.mjs,
 * yielding the identical `{ mintToken, selfId, source }` shape so nothing downstream branches on which
 * forge a job belongs to.
 *
 * CONST-TOKEN-SCOPED-PER-JOB, stated honestly. Forgejo has no App, no installation token, and no per-job
 * mint. What it does have -- and this is the interesting part -- is a REPO-SCOPED access token, which
 * GitLab's project token also gives but GitHub's classic PAT does not. So Forgejo and Azure DevOps fail
 * OPPOSITE halves of this constraint, and it is worth being precise about which:
 *
 *   - repo-scoped         YES, and better than GitLab's. A "specific repositories" token reaches only the
 *                         repositories the operator selected.
 *   - minimally-permissioned  YES, and this is the good news: such a token may carry ONLY
 *                         `read:repository`, `write:repository`, `read:issue` and `write:issue`. There is
 *                         no all-or-nothing `api` scope to fall back to, as there is on GitLab.
 *   - host-held           YES; it lives in the worker's env and reaches a container only as an env value.
 *   - env-injected        YES; never written to /workspace, .git/config, argv, or a log.
 *   - not merge-capable   YES in practice; branch protection is the barrier and no merge API is called.
 *   - short-lived         NO. The operator mints it by hand. Forgejo offers no installation-token
 *                         equivalent, so there is no path to a bounded expiry at all.
 *
 * That last row is the whole exception, and it is the one the constitution names as the blast-radius
 * bound -- "a when, not an if" for an agent induced to exfiltrate its environment. It is inherited from
 * the accepted `gh`/`pat` gap rather than being a new class, but unlike GitHub there is no stronger path
 * to prefer, so the docs must say so where an operator chooses.
 *
 * The narrow scope has one consequence that is NOT cosmetic: a repo-scoped token cannot call `GET /user`,
 * so the bot-loop guard's identity has to come from `FORGEJO_BOT_ID` instead. See forgejo-identity.mjs --
 * and note that an unresolved identity throws here rather than degrading, because a receiver that cannot
 * recognise its own comments turns them into more paid jobs.
 *
 * All side-effecting collaborators are INJECTED, so the module is testable offline with no Forgejo.
